# CT_View_Planning_DeepRL
Automatic View Planning for Computed Tomography using Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

This method of view planning is adapted from OpenAI gyms 2D Maze. We have created a custom environment that takes a slice of a 3D CT image, and uses Reinforcement Learning to center some anatomical feature of interest into the field of view which is represented as a red square.
